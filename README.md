## Usage

This dataset is a valuable resource for analysts, researchers, and financial professionals seeking to understand borrowing behaviors, creditworthiness assessment, and lending practices in the context of the Prosper platform.

## Summary of Findings

- Loan Term Preferences: The 36-month loan term is the most popular choice among borrowers, while the 12-month term is less common. This consistency across various employment categories suggests its favorable appeal.

- APR Distribution: The APR distribution reveals multiple peaks, indicating varying interest rates. Higher Prosper Scores generally correspond to lower APRs, but exceptions exist, particularly for lower-score borrowers opting for shorter-term loans.

- Borrower Categories: Student borrowers from technical schools showcase unexpectedly high Prosper Scores, reflecting positive creditworthiness perceptions. Conversely, college sophomores exhibit lower Prosper Scores, suggesting higher risk.

- Employment Impact: Self-employed and not employed borrowers tend to have lower Prosper Scores, potentially resulting in higher APRs. Employed borrowers have more "current" loans, highlighting their repayment reliability.

- Loan Fulfillment: Borrowers primarily complete their loans successfully, contributing to the platform's positive track record. This, coupled with a significant number of borrowers being employed, enhances lenders' confidence.

- Loan Purposes: Debt consolidation stands out as the prevalent reason for borrowing, while infrequent requests for cosmetic procedures and engagement rings suggest these specific purposes are less common motivators.

- These findings offer a multifaceted view of borrowing dynamics, borrower attributes, and lending outcomes within the Prosper platform, shedding light on critical aspects influencing credit decisions and interest rates.


## Key Insights for Presentation

- Impact of Prosper Scores on Borrowing: Highlight the correlation between Prosper Scores and borrower attributes such as APR and loan terms. Emphasize how higher Prosper Scores generally lead to lower APRs and explore exceptions where lower-score borrowers choose shorter-term loans with higher APRs.

- Employment Status and Loan Fulfillment: Showcase the significance of employment status on loan fulfillment. Demonstrate how employed borrowers predominantly have "current" loans, reflecting their steady repayment, while self-employed and not employed individuals tend to have lower Prosper Scores and potentially higher APRs.

These insights illustrate the interplay of creditworthiness assessment, borrower choices, and loan outcomes within the Prosper platform. Visual aids and concise narratives should be incorporated to make these threads engaging and accessible to the presentation audience.
